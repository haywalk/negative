# PixelPoke

This is a simple program that, when run, will take in an image file as an argument and create an inverted version of that image.

Usage (in the directory with the .class file): `$ java PixelPoke [input.jpg] [output.jpg]` or if you follow the instructions in `pkg/`, you can use `$ negative [input.jpg] [output.jpg]`.
