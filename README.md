# PixelPoke

This is a simple Java program that, when run, will take in an image file as an argument and create a negative version of that image.

To replace an image with its negative:

`$ java -jar pixelpoke.jar [path_to_image.jpg]`

To make a photonegative of an image and store it in a new image file:

`$ java -jar pixelpoke.jar [path_normal_image.jpg] [path_to_new_image.jpg]`
